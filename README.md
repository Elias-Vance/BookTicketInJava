# BookingTrainTicket（In Pure Java）

This is a train ticket booking system written entirely in Java, complete with built-in mock data files. It's ideal for beginners who are just starting to learn Java. The project primarily utilizes Java's UI components and object-oriented programming syntax.

## Features

The system features a complete and robust login and registration functionality, along with capabilities for booking tickets, querying tickets, checking stations, refunding tickets, and modifying reservations.

## Usage

If you're using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, you can directly open the project folder. The project is built as a Maven project, so you can also simply take the `pom.xml` file and use it directly.
